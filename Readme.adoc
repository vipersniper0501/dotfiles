= How to install

To install first clone the repo using: `git clone git@github.com:vipersniper0501/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dot_cfg`
 
Then, run `git --git-dir=/home/$USER/.dot_cfg/.git --work-tree=$HOME checkout -f`

Once the checkout is run, create a new session to see the newly applied settings
in action.

In order to check the status of the repository, run `dotfile_config` and use any git
commands you should need.

For example, if you wanted to see the status of the dotfile repo, run 
`dotfile_config status --untracked-files=no` to see what files have changed in 
the repo (the `-u no` flag makes it so you don't see untracked files 
that are not in the repo).

If you wanted to add a file to the repo just run `dotfile_config add <file>` just
like you would in any other repo and commit away.

Instructions for configuring Tmux are found in the .tmux.conf file.
